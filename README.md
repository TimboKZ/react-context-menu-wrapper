# React context menu wrapper

This component provides a simple wrapper for your context menu content. It will handle the right click event and menu 
positioning, but the rest is up to you.

Unlike other React context menu packages, this one does not provide any styling or pre-made components - you'll 
have to style the context menu yourself. This is useful when your CSS framework provides dropdown styling - consider 
dropdowns [from Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/dropdowns/) or
[from Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/dropdown/).

# Installation
